"I swing open the door - piles and piles of gasoline containers and propane tanks litter the room. {a}Holy shit."

Gwen|"He's really gonna blow this place up."

narrator|"I open the valves to the propane, snatch the first canister in front of me, and unscrew the cap. {a}[playSound(effect_liquid_shake)]The pungent liquid surges out when I dump it over the other containers around the entrance before dragging the trail out of the room."|showBackground(living_room,true,1)|playAmbientMusic(ambient_fireplace, 0.1,0.0)

narrator|"I trail the gas down the hall until I reach the living room. {a}Flames are still blazing in the fireplace - exactly what I needed."

Gwen|"VICTOR!"

narrator|"[playSound(effect_crash_faraway]I hear one final crash and then heavy footsteps thud above me towards the stairs. {a}[playSound(effect_stairs)]Victor's face appears at the top as he almost trips down them to the first floor."

Victor|"Good work, Gwen."

narrator|"He grabs my hand."

Victor|"Throw it in the fire and let's GO!"

narrator|"I chuck the last of the gasoline into the open fire and Victor pulls me down the hallway towards the broken window.[playSound(effect_run_inside)] {a}Glass cuts into my hands and legs and we tumble out onto the grass."

Gwen|"[playSound(effect_explosion)]Shit!"

narrator|"[showBackground(mansion_burning,true,1)|playAmbientMusic(ambient_fire,0.2,0)]The explosion rocks the earth beneath us and debris flies through the air. {a}Victor pulls me to my feet and we sprint away from the mansion, not stopping until we reach the edge of the forest.

"We did it! {a}It worked!"

"Victor and I both turn, staring at the crimson inferno before us. {a}I can see his mother pounding on an upstairs window."

Gwen|"Will she jump?"

Victor|"If she does, she'll die."

narrator|"I grab his arm and tug him deeper into the forest."

Gwen|"Don't watch. {a}Let's just go."

narrator|"He nods. {a}Together we enter the woods, leaving the mansion behind us."|stopAmbientMusic()|playAmbientMusic(ambient_fire,0.05,0)

narrator|"The rain is lighter now, and the storm is still. {a}All I hear is the roaring fire behind me and our feet sloshing across the muddy forest floor."

"I let the silence between us hang in the air. {a}So much just happened. {a}Everything I thought I knew about Victor changed in less than an hour. {a}Now that my adrenaline is retreating, I can't stop thinking about what we'll do when we reach the bottom of the mountain."

Victor|"I killed a lot of people, Gwen."

Gwen|"Yeah. {a}I figured."

Victor|"You can't let me get away with it."

Gwen|"But you were forced into it."

Victor|"Stop."

narrator|"He turns to face me and we both stop walking."

Victor|"I'm turning myself in when we reach the bottom."

narrator|"When I meet his gaze, I notice he doesn't look sad. {a}He looks relieved, his eyes soft."

Victor|"I'm free now. {a}Thanks to you."

narrator|"He pulls me into a tight hug and I wrap my arms around him."

"We stand there for a moment, the ashes of mansion mingling with the rainfall and misting over our shoulders."

"It's over."
