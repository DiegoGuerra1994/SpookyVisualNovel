"I swing open the door - piles and piles of gasoline containers and propane tanks litter the room. {a}Holy shit."

Gwen|"He's really gonna blow this place up."

narrator|"I open the valves to the propane, snatch the first canister in front of me, and unscrew the cap, drizzling the pungent liquid around the entrance before dragging it out of the room."

Victor|"Good work, Gwen."

narrator|"He grabs my hand."

Victor|"Throw it in the fire and let's GO!"

narrator|"I chuck the last of the gasoline into the open fire and Victor pulls me down the hallway towards the broken window.[playSound(effect_run_inside)] {a}Glass cuts into my hands and legs and we tumble out onto the grass."

"Victor and I both turn, staring at the crimson inferno before us. {a}I can see his mother pounding on an upstairs window."

Gwen|"Will she jump?"

Victor|"No. {a}She knows she can't survive that."

narrator|"I grab his arm and tug him deeper into the forest."

Gwen|"Don't watch. {a}Let's just go."

"I let the silence between us hang in the air. {a}So much just happened. {a}Everything I thought I knew about Victor changed in less than an hour. {a}Now that my adrenaline is retreating, I can't stop thinking about what we'll do when we reach the bottom of the mountain."

Victor|"I killed a lot of people, Gwen."

Gwen|"Yeah. {a}I figured."

Victor|"You can't let me get away with it."

Gwen|"But you were forced into it."

Victor|"Stop."

narrator|"He turns to face me and we both stop walking."

Victor|"I'm turning myself in when we reach the bottom."

Victor|"I'm free now. {a}Thanks to you."

"We stand there for a moment, the ashes of mansion mingling with the rainfall and misting over our shoulders."

"It's over."
