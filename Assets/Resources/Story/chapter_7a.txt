"I swing open the door - piles and piles of gasoline containers and propane tanks litter the room. {a}Holy shit."

Gwen|"[setPosition(Gwen,0.5,0)|changeExpression(Gwen,body,stand)|changeExpression(Gwen,face,shock)|enter(Gwen)]He's really gonna blow this place up."

narrator|"[changeExpression(Gwen,face,unamused)]I open the valves to the propane, snatch the first canister in front of me, and unscrew the cap. {a}[playSound(effect_liquid_shake)]The pungent liquid surges out when I dump it over the other containers around the entrance before dragging the trail out of the room."|setBackground(living_room_dark,true,1)|playAmbientMusic(ambient_fireplace, 0.5,0.0)

narrator|"The gas glugs sloppily from the container as I pour it down the hall. {a}Flames are still blazing in the fireplace - exactly what I needed."

Gwen|"[changeExpression(Gwen,face,angrytalk)|flip(Gwen)]VICTOR!"

narrator|"[playSound(effect_crash_faraway]I hear one final crash and then heavy footsteps thud above me towards the stairs. {a}[playSound(effect_stairs)]Victor's face appears at the top as he almost trips down them to the first floor."

Victor|"[changeExpression(Victor,body,standarmsblood)|changeExpression(Victor,face,angrytalk)]Throw it in the fire and let's GO!"

narrator|"[exit(Victor)|exit(Gwen)]I chuck the last of the gasoline into the open fire and Victor pulls me down the hallway towards the broken window.[playSound(effect_run_inside)] {a}Glass cuts into my hands and legs and we tumble out onto the grass."

narrator|"[playSound(effect_explosion)|setBackground(mansion_burning,true,1)|playAmbientMusic(ambient_fire,0.5,0)]The explosion rocks the earth beneath us and debris flies through the air. {a}Victor pulls me to my feet and we sprint away from the mansion, not stopping until we reach the edge of the forest. [playSound(effect_run_gravel)]"

"We did it! {a}It worked!"

"Victor and I both turn, staring at the crimson inferno before us. {a}I can see his mother pounding on an upstairs window."

Gwen|"Will she jump?"

Victor|"If she does, she'll die."

narrator|"I grab his arm and tug him deeper into the forest."

Gwen|"Don't watch. {a}Let's just go."

narrator|"He nods. {a}Together we enter the woods, leaving the mansion behind us."|stopAmbientMusic()|playAmbientMusic(ambient_fire,0.2,0)|setBackground(forest,true,1)

narrator|"The rain is lighter now, and the storm is still. {a}All I hear is the roaring fire behind me and our feet sloshing across the muddy forest floor."

"I let the silence between us hang in the air. {a}So much just happened. {a}Everything I thought I knew about Victor changed in less than an hour. {a}Now that my adrenaline is retreating, I can't stop thinking about what we'll do when we reach the bottom of the mountain."

Victor|"[setPosition(Victor,0.25,0)|changeExpression(Victor,body,standblood)|changeExpression(Victor,face,unamusedtalk)|enter(Victor)]I killed a lot of people, Gwen."

Gwen|"[setPosition(Gwen,0.75,0)|changeExpression(Gwen,body,stand)|changeExpression(Gwen,face,unamusedtalk)|enter(Gwen)]Yeah. {a}I figured. {a}I do have a question for you, Victor."

Victor|"Yes?"

Gwen|"[flip(Gwen)]Back there, your mother said that you have a 'craving', that your entire family does."

Victor"........."

Gwen|"Is it true?"

Victor|"[changeExpression(Victor,face,sadtalk)]... No. I've never felt it."

Gwen|"[changeExpression(Gwen,face,sadtalk)]Then why did they think that?"

Victor|"[changeExpression(Victor,face,happy)|flip(Victor)]Who knows. I guess I didn't take after them as much as they thought I did."

Gwen|"[changeExpression(Gwen,face,happy)|flip(Gwen)]Ha... that's a relief."

narrator|"Victor is quiet next to me, tense."

Victor|"[changeExpression(Victor,face,sad)]But, even still, you can't let me get away with all of that."

Gwen|"[changeExpression(Gwen,face,sad)]You were forced into it. You said so yourself."

Victor|"Stop."

narrator|"[flip(Victor)]He turns to face me and we both stop walking."

Victor|"[changeExpression(Victor,face,happytalk)]It was my choice, and I can't make any excuses. I could have fought back earlier and saved all those lives. I'm turning myself in when we reach the bottom."

narrator|"When I meet his gaze, I notice he doesn't look sad. {a}He looks relieved, his eyes soft."

Victor|"[changeExpression(Victor,face,happy)]I'm free now. {a}Thanks to you."

narrator|"He pulls me into a tight hug and I wrap my arms around him."

"[exit(Gwen)|exit(Victor)]We stand there for a moment, the ashes of mansion mingling with the rainfall and misting over our shoulders."

"It's over."
