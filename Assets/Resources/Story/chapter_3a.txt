"I tumble into the room and quickly turn and close the door. {a}{a}{a}I don't want them to know this lock wasn't broken."

"I crawl over to a bed in the center of the room and crouch behind it as I stare at the door. {a}{a}{a}Pounding footsteps approach from down the hallway."

Woman|"Did you see where she went?"

Man|"Damn, no. {a}{a}{a}But we smashed all of Victor's locks. {a}{a}{a}She can't be in any of these rooms."

Woman|"Ugh. {a}{a}{a}Maybe we missed her downstairs."

Man|"Yeah, maybe. {a}{a}{a}Let's go."

narrator|"The intruders retreat and I let the knife fall from my grip onto the carpeted floor. {a}{a}{a}Tears roll down my cheeks. {a}{a}{a}This is all too much."

Gwen|"That was w-way too close. {a}{a}{a}Wait, how did they know Victor..."

narrator|"They said his name in the hallway. {a}{a}{a}Do they know him? {a}{a}{a}Have I met them before?"

"I shiver at the thought of it being someone I know. {a}{a}{a}How could they do this to us?"

"I stand, using the bed for support, and take in my surroundings. {a}{a}{a}It looks like another guest bedroom."

"But… it can't be. {a}{a}{a}Why would Victor put it behind that lock if it was just that?"

"I plop down on the bed, trying to collect my thoughts and calm my nerves. {a}{a}{a}There's fake stars glued to the ceiling, and they glow a faint neon green in the darkness. {a}{a}{a}It's a little comforting. {a}{a}{a}I remember having stars like this as a kid."

"Wait... {a}{a}didn't Victor say he had those, too? {a}{a}{a}When he was young?"

"Is this his childhood room?"

"I sit up and move to the dresser nearby and look at one of the framed photos - no doubt, that's Victor. {a}{a}{a}Just twenty years younger."

"One of the pictures looks like his high school graduation photo. {a}{a}{a}Aw. {a}{a}{a}Scruffy, unkempt blonde hair under a graduation cap, kind of awkward-looking but still cute."

"Two people have their arms around him, a man and a woman. {a}{a}{a}Must be his extended family, since it can't be his parents."

"Victor said his parents died when he was young, and I never pried more into that. {a}{a}{a}He seemed troubled every time the topic came up. {a}{a}{a}I could understand, with my parents abandoning me and all that. {a}{a}{a}But it does hurt a little different, I suppose."

"I need to lay low for a bit. {a}{a}{a}The man and woman are probably still looking for me together, so it wouldn't be worth it to go out again anyway for a while."

"I open the first drawer of Victor's dresser, curious what teenage-him tucked away. {a}{a}{a}Poorly hidden, I dig under the pile of socks to a locked box and tug it out."

"It has that familiar electronic lock on the front. {a}{a}{a}I wonder what he has hidden inside. {a}{a}{a}God, I hope it’s not anything a boy going through puberty would want to lock away...".

"I know it's an invasion of privacy, but I need something to keep my mind off the people looking for me."

"It clicks open and I lift the lid. {a}{a}{a}There's a small notebook tucked inside, with Victor's name scrawled on the front in a black marker."

        "Flipping through the pages, it looks like he kept this diary during high school. {a}{a}The date ranges line up, at least."

        "I turn to the final entry. {a}{a}The date at the top of the page is from around the time he would have graduated. {a}{a}Why'd he stop writing when he graduated? {a}{a}Maybe he says why somewhere here."

        "'Hey, it's me again. {a}{a}I have no idea what to do.'"

        "'Mom and Dad approached me just a few minutes ago with a giant, old crate. {a}{a}They told me something… terrible. {a}{a}A horrible, awful family secret.'"

        Gwen|"A secret?"

        narrator|"'I can't even write it out here - I feel like I'm going to vomit just thinking about it. {a}{a}I don't want to be a part of this. {a}{a}The things they had in the box… ugh.'"

        "'My dad told me I had to do this to survive. {a}{a}He said if I didn't participate, if I didn't help them do this, that they would kill me!'"

        "'I'm not sure what to do, but I know I don't want to do this. {a}{a}However... {a}{a}I also don't want to die, especially by their hands. {a}{a}I can’t believe they're threatening to end my life...'"

        "'Anyway. {a}{a}This is the last you'll hear from me. {a}{a}No matter what happens, I'm sure I can't write it in here anymore.'"

        "'I hope I'm still around after this. {a}{a}Thank you for holding my thoughts all these years.'"

        "It ends there."

        "What the hell is this? {a}{a}I thought his parents died way before high school?"

        "He lied to me. {a}{a}I'm guessing it has to do with what they told him, then."

        "Maybe he rejected his parents, and… and they disappeared? {a}{a}That doesn't make sense. {a}{a}They threatened to kill him."

        "I look at the bedroom door, where the intruders were standing behind minutes before."

        Gwen|"Maybe that's them. {a}{a}Maybe they're killing him tonight."

        narrator|"That has to be it. {a}{a}They've been stalking him for years, tracking him - that's how they know who I am, too!"

        "I place the diary back in the lockbox and close it, placing it back in the drawer. {a}{a}He should have told me about this. {a}{a}I of all people would understand abusive parents."
