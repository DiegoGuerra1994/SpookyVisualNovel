Woman|"Did you see where she went?"

Man|"Damn, no. {a}But we smashed all of Victor's locks. {a}She can't be in any of these rooms."

narrator|"[playSound(effect_walk_womanlibrary_soft)]The intruders retreat and I let the knife fall from my grip onto the carpeted floor. {a}Tears roll down my cheeks. {a}This is all too much."

Gwen|"[setPosition(Gwen,0.5,0)|changeExpression(Gwen,body,stand)|changeExpression(Gwen,face,sad)|enter(Gwen)]That was w-way too close. {a}Wait, how did they know Victor..."

narrator|"They said his name in the hallway. {a}Do they know him? {a}Have I met them before?"

"I shiver at the thought of it being someone I know. {a}How could they do this to us?"

"[flip(Gwen)|moveCharacter(Gwen,0.75,0)]I stand, using the bed for support, and take in my surroundings. {a}It looks like another guest bedroom."

"But... it can't be. {a}Why would Victor put it behind that lock if it was just that?"

"[changeExpression(Gwen,body,standarmsbehind)|changeExpression(Gwen,face,neutral)]I plop down on the bed, trying to collect my thoughts and calm my nerves. {a}There's fake stars glued to the ceiling, and they glow a faint neon green in the darkness. {a}It's a little comforting. {a}I remember having stars like this as a kid."

"Wait, didn't Victor say he had those, too? {a}When he was young?"

"Is this his childhood room?"

"[moveCharacter(Gwen,0.4,0)|changeExpression(Gwen,face,neutral)]I sit up and move to the dresser nearby and look at one of the framed photos - no doubt, that's Victor. {a}Just twenty years younger."

"One of the pictures looks like his high school graduation photo. {a}Aw. {a}Scruffy, unkempt blonde hair under a graduation cap, kind of awkward-looking but still cute."

"Two people have their arms around him, a man and a woman. {a}Must be his extended family, since it can't be his very dead parents."

"Victor seems troubled every time his parents came up in conversation. {a}I could understand, with my parents abandoning me and all that. {a}But it does hurt a little different, I suppose."

"Anyways, I need to lay low for a bit. {a}The man and woman are probably still looking for me together, so it wouldn't be worth it to go out again for a while."

"[playSound(effect_drawer_open)|moveCharacter(Gwen,0.3,0)]I open the first drawer of Victor's dresser, curious what teenage-him tucked away. {a}Poorly hidden, I dig under the pile of socks to a locked box and tug it out."

"It has that familiar electronic lock on the front. {a}I wonder what he has hidden inside. {a}[changeExpression(Gwen,face,unamused)|flip(Gwen)]God, I hope itâ€™s not anything a boy going through puberty would want to lock away..."
