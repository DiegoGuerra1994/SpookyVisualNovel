"I curl up further into the leather couch, turning the page of my book. {a}No trick-or-treaters tonight, it seems."

"The mansion - my boyfriend's mansion - sits at the top of a mountain, miles up a windy road from a small town nearby. {a}When I first started living here my boyfriend told me that this mansion has been in his family for generations."|setPosition(Gwen,.5,0)|changeExpression(Gwen,body,stand)|changeExpression(Gwen,face,neutral)|enter(Gwen,1,true)

"I've only been dating Victor for a few months now. {a}In that little time, however, I've come to learn just how much that garden means to him. {a}It sprawls across the entire roof, with varying flowers, vegetables, and herbs packed into growers."

"He's told me stories about how his mom loved to work with him on the garden - I think that was his favorite thing to do with her. {a}Together, they transformed it from cracked cement to brilliant greenery."|playSound(effect_thunder2)

"This mansion can be like a labyrinth, sometimes - to be honest, I'm not used to living somewhere with this many rooms.{a} I didn't exactly grow up in the lap of luxury."

"Victor's parents died when he was young, and my parents abandoned me when I was twelve, so we could relate immediately on some level when we met. {a}Trauma bonding and all that."

Gwen|"[setPosition(Gwen,.75,0)|changeExpression(Gwen,body,standarmsbehind)|changeExpression(Gwen,face,neutral)|enter(Gwen,0,false)]It's nice to have a place to really call home again."

narrator|"After meandering and making some bad turns, I finally find it - the roof ladder!{a} Well, more like the door leading to the ladder."

"It may seem surprising that I haven't seen most of Victor's mansion. {a}He has these strange locks on every door that need a code to be opened, but he only gave me a handful of codes to use for the rooms he dubbed 'safe'. {a}According to him, some of the rooms are too old and decrepit could be damaged if someone goes into them."

"Each lock functions like a simple cypher. {a}I just have to check the card number and enter in the corresponding code. {a}I think I have that key on me."

"I sense that Victor is a little fond of math, since all the codes on here look like the card number times ten. {a}Cute."

"Anyway, let's enter in the code and unlock this door."|exit(Gwen)

"[moveCharacter(Gwen,0.25,0)]I walk up to one of the windows and glance around the front of the mansion.{a} The expansive lawn is an acre long, stretching to the forest edge. Victor and I have often hiked through that forest - it's almost like he has a private set of trails since no one else really comes up here."|playSound(effect_thunder1)
