narrator|"It's Halloween tonight. {a}A storm pounds against the walls of this mansion, raindrops tapping impatiently against the glass window near the glowing fireplace."

"I curl up further into the leather couch, turning the page of my book. {a}No trick-or-treaters tonight, it seems. {a}I'm not sure how they'd make it up here in the storm."

"The mansion - my boyfriend's mansion - sits at the top of a mountain, miles up a windy road from a small town nearby. {a}When I first started living here my boyfriend told me that this mansion has been in his family for generations."

narrator|"Another crack of thunder. {a}I glance up towards the roof. {a}Is the garden okay?"

"I've only been dating Victor for a few months now. {a}In that little time, however, I've come to learn just how much that garden means to him. {a}It sprawls across the entire roof, with varying flowers, vegetables, and herbs packed into growers beneath absurdly large trees. {a}Trees! {a}On his roof!"

"This storm sounds bad - I better go check on the garden. {a}I set my book down and head up the stairs, leaving the warmth of the fire behind me."|playSound(effect_stairs)

"This mansion can be like a labyrinth, sometimes. {a}I'm not used to living somewhere with this many rooms.{c}I grew up poor, and my parents abandoned me when I was barely in high school. {a}Victor's wealth was a little shocking at first, but his hospitality has helped ease me into this new lifestyle."

Gwen|"Left[txtSpd 30,1]...[/txtSpd]Right?"

narrator|"After meandering and making some bad turns, I finally find it - the ladder!{a} Well, more like the door leading to the ladder."

"I haven't seen most of Victor's mansion. {a}He has these strange locks on every door that need a code to be opened. {a}He only gave me a handful of codes to use for the rooms that are safe. {a}He says some of the rooms are too old and could be damaged if someone goes into them, and since I'm a guest I don't want to question him further."

"Ah, well, I am glad I have the codes necessary to get onto the roof. {a}Let's see what we have here."

"Each puzzle is like a simple cypher to unlock. {a}I just have to check the card number, and line it up with the number in the key. {a}I think I have the key on me."

"I think Victor is a little fond of math. {a}Cute. {a}These all just look like the card number times ten!"

"Let's enter the correct code in."

narrator|"I've done this so many times that I could probably just memorize it if I wanted to."

"When the door opens, there's a rope hanging in front of me. {a}I pull it and the ladder to the roof slides down soundlessly, oiled to perfection."

"When I come out I notice that the cover to the greenhouse is already up. {a}Victor must have checked weather reports and raised it when I didn't notice."

"I walk to the edge of the roof and see the mechanical gears lined up neatly. {a}It must have automatically wound out once it sensed rain. {a}I've never been up here during a storm. {a}Come to think of it though, Victor did seem pretty unphased during the last storm. {a}Now i feel a little stupid for worrying."

"I walk up to one of the windows and glance around the front of the mansion.{a} The expansive lawn is an acre long, stretching to the forest that surrounds the windy path."

Gwen|"I hope Victor will be okay driving in this storm."

narrator|"I'm sure he's upset about it. {a}He's told me many times that Halloween is his favorite holiday - and it's ruined!"

"For a moment, the thunder stops rumbling. {a}The rain patters a little more gently on the thin roof above me."

Gwen|"Ah! {a}A crash?"

narrator|"It sounded like it came from the other side of the mansion!"

"I run across the roof garden to the other side, peering out the fogged up window."

Gwen|"W[txtSpeed 30,1] - [\txtSpeed]What was that?"

narrator|"It looked like something just jumped into a window downstairs!"

Gwen|"Oh, no!"

"Were they relying on the storm to cover the sound of the crash? {a}On cue, the thunder picks up again."

"What should I do?? {a}If I go for the phone downstairs, I might run into them!"

"Or should I run to the attic? {a}There's a small hatch on the roof that leads directly there."
