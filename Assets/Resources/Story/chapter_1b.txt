"[changeExpression(Gwen,body,standarmsbehind)|changeExpression(Gwen,face,neutral)|flip(Gwen)]Lucky... but it's strange. {a}It's not like Victor to leave doors like this open."

"There's no windows in here, and I can't hear the storm anymore. {a}I settle into the desk chair with a sigh. {a}No phone in sight, but at least I can take a breather."

"There's more bookshelves in here next to a desk. {a}The spines are much more worn and weathered compared to the volumes in the library."

"I tilt my head to read the titles. {a}'19th Century African Safaris'. {a}'Encyclopedia of Knives, Swords, Spears & Daggers'. {a}'Aztecs and Sacrifice'. {a}Eh. [moveCharacter(Gwen,.5,0)]{a}Just more historical non-fiction. {a}Victor has always had an interest in that kind of stuff."

"I scan along, feeling calmer while skimming through his titles. {a}'Leather + Hide'. {a}Is this about how people make leather?"

[changeExpression(Gwen,face,shock)|moveCharacter(Gwen,.6,0)]{a}This looks just like one of Victor's keys! {a}There's a different card suit on it, and a different set of numbers lined up. {a}[playSound(effect_tape)]I grab some tape off the desk and attach it to the key scrap I already have, tucking the tape into my back pocket."

"I'm sure this will come in handy later. {a}I'm suddenly glad my boyfriend uses codes to lock doors instead of keys - there's no way the intruders could pick their way in."
