"I notice a light in the corner of the library. {a}Is that Victor's office?"

"There's no windows in here, and I can't hear the storm anymore. {a}I settle into a chair with a sigh. {a}No phone in sight, but at least I can take a breather."

"There's more bookshelves in here next to a desk. {a}The spines look almost ancient compared to the volumes in the library."

"I scan along, feeling calmer while skimming through his titles. {a}'Leather + Hide'. {a}Is this about how people make leather?"
