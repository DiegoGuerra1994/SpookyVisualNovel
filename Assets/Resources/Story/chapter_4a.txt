"[playSound(effect_run_gravel)]I jog across the edge of the forest, which thankfully blocks some of the rainfall. {a}If I can make it to the side of the mansion, I can sneak in through the broken window."

narrator|"At the side of the mansion, I grip my knife tightly and advance out of the safety of the forest. {a}I move slowly, taking deep breaths - I need to be calm, focused."

"At the broken window, I peek into the dark hallway. {a}I don't see any visible movement, and I don't hear anything - at least, I don't hear anything over the storm around me."

"I quickly run over and pick it up. {a}Another key!"

"I tape it to the other keys and smile.[playSound(effect_tape)] {a}Victor dropped this. {a}He must have known I'd come back."

"With this last key, I'm pretty sure I can get into every single room in the mansion. {a}I rack my brain, struggling to think of any room that I've noticed with a heavily coded lock. {a}Maybe a room that Victor specifically told me to avoid?"

"A few months ago, Victor and I were cooking in the kitchen and I asked him about an odd lock on the floor."

"Victor told me the hatch under the lock led to his basement. {a}He asked me not to go down since it had some personal items in it. {a}I wasn't bothered at the time, since we still barely knew each other."

"That has to be it. {a}It's the only room he's explicitly told me not to enter. {a}Of course he'd carry the final key on him!"

"He must have led them into there and dropped this for me to follow."|showBackground(kitchen,true,1)

"One minute, then two minutes pass. {a}No movement. {a}I think I'm safe."
