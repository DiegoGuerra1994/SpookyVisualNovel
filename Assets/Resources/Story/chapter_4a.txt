"With this last key, I'm pretty sure I can get into every single room in the mansion. {a}I rack my brain, struggling to think of any room that I've noticed with a heavily coded lock. {a}Maybe a room that Victor specifically told me to avoid?"

"[exit(Gwen)]A few months ago, Victor and I were cooking in the kitchen and I asked him about an odd lock on the floor."

"Victor told me the hatch under the lock led to his basement. {a}He asked me not to go down since it had some personal items in it. {a}I wasn't bothered at the time, since we still barely knew each other."

"That has to be it. {a}It's the only room he's explicitly told me not to enter. {a}Of course he'd carry the final key on him!"

"He must have led them into there and dropped this for me to follow."|setBackground(kitchen,true,1)
