"My eyes wander around the room until it settles on a cabinet in a corner, locked with one of those special locks. {a}That's been sealed ever since I've moved in. {a}When I asked Victor what was in it, he said it was just antique kitchenware locked for safekeeping."

"Odd that he wouldn't want them displayed, though. {a}I'd at least store them in a glass case, or something."

"[setBackground(knifepile,true,1)]Laying on the cabinet shelves are piles of knives, scattered, unsorted. {a}This isn't like Victor."

"They range from dingy stone knives to razor sharp steel blades, some as short as three inches and some as long as my forearm. {a}They do all look a little old, but… I'm not sure why Victor would lock these up."

Gwen|"[setBackground(kitchen,true,1)|changeExpression(Gwen,body,standarmsbehind)|changeExpression(Gwen,face,neutral)|enter(Gwen)]Maybe they're worth a fortune?"

"It always made me wonder what could possibly be behind the other doors. {a}What else does he need?"

"At the end of the hallway, I pause, eyes locked on the entrance to the final room."

"There's a small window at the top of the door, and when I peek in I see a workbench with papers scattered around."
