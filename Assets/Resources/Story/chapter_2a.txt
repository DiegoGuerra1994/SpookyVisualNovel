"I can't hear anything through the door this time. {a}Damn. {a}How will I know when it's safe?"

"I glance around the kitchen. {a}Kept perfectly clean, everything in its place. {a}Victor is a bit of a neat freak, so I know no one has trashed this place yet. {a}I'd rather him be this way than a slob though."

"The knives are gleaming in the moonlight from a skylight above. {a}The butcher knife is at the end of the row, exactly where I thought it would be."

"I walk to the counter and reach up for the handle. {a}When I pull it off the wall, it feels a little heavy in my hands. {a}It's been a while since I've used this knife in the kitchen."

"Can I actually do this? {a}Can I actually… you know, stab someone?"

"I guess with this it'd be more of a chop than a stab, huh? {a}I can probably chop someone..."

Gwen|"Ha..."

narrator|"When can I leave the kitchen? {a}I wish I could hear anything outside the door. {a}Damn."

"My eyes wander around the room until it settles on a cabinet in a corner, locked with one of those special locks. {a}That's been sealed ever since I've moved in. {a}When I asked Victor what was in it, he said it was just antique kitchenware that was locked away so it couldn't be stolen."

"Odd that he wouldn't want them displayed, though. {a}I'd at least lock them in a glass case, or something."

"I kneel down in front of the cabinet, tapping the screen."|playSound(effect_screen_tap)

Gwen|"Oh! {a}Wait, I think I can unlock this!"

narrator|"Let's give it a shot."|exit(Gwen)

loadPuzzle(puzzle2,key1,901101816130830)

"Done! {a}The door swings open."

"Laying on the cabinet shelves are piles of knives, scattered, unsorted. {a}This isn't like Victor."

"They range from dingy stone knives to razor sharp steel blades, some as short as three inches and some as long as my forearm. {a}They do all look a little old, but… I'm not sure why Victor would lock these up."

Gwen|"Maybe they're worth a fortune?"

narrator|"There's something under the knife pile - another scrap of paper!"

"It's another suit and another set of numbers. {a}This is getting a little complicated. {a}I tape it to my key and turn back to the pile of knives."

"I pick up one of the longer ones. {a}The sharp tip gleams in the light. {a}This one might be better than the butcher knife"

"Standing, I put the butcher knife back and swing my new knife a bit, getting used to the weight. {a}It's lighter, faster. {a}Definitely easier to use to defend myself."

"I approach the kitchen door, taking a deep breath. {a}You can do this, Gwen. {a}My hand gripping the knife starts to sweat."

"There's no way to know if someone will be behind the door. {a}But I have to open it."

"I push it open[playSound(effect_door_open], brandishing my knife in my right hand and ready to strike as my eyes move around the living room."|setBackground(living_room,true,1)

"No one. {a}I got lucky."

"[playSound(effect_thunder1)]The thunder cracks loudly and a flash of lightning blinds me through the window. {a}With a loud pop[playSound(effect_light_pop)], the lights blow out and the mansion dims."

Gwen|"Shit."

narrator|"The fireplace is now the only source of light in the entire mansion, aside from the occasional flash from the lightning outside. {a}I wish I could stay by the fire forever, reading my book, and not worrying about getting my throat slit."

"But for now, I need to decide where to go. {a}I've heard two people in the mansion so far, but there could be more. {a}If they are separated, though, I might have a chance."

"Let's check around downstairs. {a}I know for sure that someone was recently here, and with any luck they're still down here. {a}Alone."

"On top of that... I've never heard more than one person at a time. {a}The chances are high that they are wandering around alone."|setBackground(hallway_down_dark,true,1)

"No light, as expected. {a}Every single door in the long hallway is shut."

"Are they hiding? {a}Are they waiting for me?"

"I shake my head. {a}I can't back out now."

"Slowly, I move through the hallway. {a}Every door I pass looms behind me, and I strain to listen for the sound of any of them opening behind me."

"I've been in some of these rooms before. {a}Guest bedrooms, bathrooms, a sauna... Victor really has it all."

"It always made me wonder what could possibly be behind the other doors. {a}What else does he need?"

"At the end of the hallway, I pause, eyes locked on the entrance to the final room."

"There's a small window at the top of the door, and when I peek in I see a workbench with papers scattered around."

"...and a man is leaning over that workbench, faced away from the door."

"I duck down. {a}My hand grips the knife against my chest. {a}The man inside is alone - unaware. {a}This is my chance."

"I turn to the door, and see a lock. {a}Damn. {a}Can I open it?"

"My fingers carefully press the touchpad and the code buzzes to life on the screen."

"I run to the library door and[playSound(effect_door_locked)] turn the knob but the door doesn't budge. {a}Do I need to unlock it?"

Gwen|"Oh, shit. {a}The lock…"

"As I run down the winding hallway, I see that all of the locks have been smashed. {a}No!"

"At the end of the hall, I stumble to a stop and place my hands on my knees, gasping for breath. {a}Dead end. {a}They'll find me any minute now."

"I glance at the door in front of me. {a}Smashed. {a}As expected."

"Wait? {a}It looks like the screen is still functioning! {a}[playSound(effect_screen_tap)]I tap the screen and the code buzzes to life. {a}Yes!"

"I have to open this door!"
