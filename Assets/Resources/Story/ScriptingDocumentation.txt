#Character Speech:
	Character speech is set up so if you want a character to start speaking, you have to first write the name followed by the '|'. The '|' is use as a delimiter, so make sure it is there.
	Format:						EX:
		<NAME>|"<STRING>"			Raelin|"Hi, my name is Raelin. What's yours?"

	After a name is supplied, you don't need to use the name again unless a new character is speaking
		Format					EX:
			<NAME>|"<STRING>"				Raelin|"Hi, my name is Raelin. What's yours?"
			<STRING>"						"Oh I guess you're just shy huh"


	Additive:
		Additives are a way to display more text without creating a new line of dialogue, it just continues from the current string:
		Format					EX:
		<NAME>|"<STRING>"			Raelin|"Hi, my name is Raelin."
		+"<STRING>"					+"What's yours?""
